# Mervo Investor Pitch (2 pages)

## 1. Problem
Field operations teams juggle jobs, contractors, and proof with unreliable connectivity. Disputes and payroll delays erode margins.

## 2. Solution
Mervo is a mobile-first field ops platform with offline-safe workflows, job/contractor management, proof capture, and payroll-ready exports.

## 3. Why Now
- Explosion of gig/contractor work
- Mobile coverage gaps demand offline resilience
- Enterprises push for auditable, secure flows (RLS, SSO)

## 4. Product
- Jobs: create/assign/track
- Contractors: profiles, ratings, availability
- Proof: clock-in/out, photos, reports
- Admin: dashboards, exports, API + Postman
- Reliability: rollback plan, smoke tests, SLOs

## 5. Market & GTM
- Beachhead: regional services companies (install/maint/inspection)
- Land with ops managers; expand to finance (payroll) and compliance teams
- Pricing tiers: Basic/Standard/Premium with add-ons (payroll, SSO)

## 6. Traction Plan
- KPIs: jobs/week, MAU/DAU, churn <3% monthly
- Playbooks: demo-to-pilot, pilot-to-paid in 30 days, feedback loop via admin dashboard
- Integrations roadmap: payroll, calendar/webhooks, SSO

## 7. Revenue Model
- Subscription per tier + usage overages (storage/jobs)
- Add-ons: payroll integration, SSO/enterprise, dedicated infra
- Annual prepay discounts to improve cash flow

## 8. Competition & Moat
- Compete on offline reliability, ease of rollout, and auditability
- Moat: domain workflow depth, mobile UX, rapid pilot conversion

## 9. Team
- Placeholder founding team: Ops, Eng, Product (TODO: update names)

## 10. Ask
- Raising: TODO amount
- Use of funds: product depth (offline + integrations), GTM, reliability
- Timeline: 18-24 months runway target

## 11. Milestones (Next 18 Months)
- T+3m: Pilot conversions with payroll export
- T+6m: SSO + enterprise reporting
- T+9m: Multi-region + localization pack
- T+12m: Net retention >110%
- T+18m: ARR targets (TODO)

## 12. Risks & Mitigation
- Connectivity variance → offline-first; queued actions with visibility
- Compliance/PII → RLS, audit logs, privacy template
- Integration friction → publish API + SDK, certified payroll partners

## 13. Closing
Mervo makes contractor operations reliable, auditable, and fast. Ready for pilot rollouts now.
