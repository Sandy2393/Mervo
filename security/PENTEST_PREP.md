# Pentest Prep (APP_ID)

## Scope
- Domains: app, api, admin. Out-of-scope: corp network.
- Assets: web, mobile, APIs, storage buckets.

## Test types
- Web app, API, auth/session, RBAC, storage, SSRF, IDOR, rate limiting, mobile API misuse.

## Process
1) Select vendor; sign NDA (TODO: legal review). Define SLAs for bug fixes.
2) Safe-list tester IPs in WAF/CDN.
3) Schedule window (UTC); avoid freeze periods.
4) Provide test accounts (least privilege) and seed data. No real PII.
5) Communication channel for findings; severity mapping to P1–P4.
6) Post-test: triage findings, fix criticals before launch, retest, publish summary.
