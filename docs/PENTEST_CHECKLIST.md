# Penetration Test Checklist — Mervo

This checklist helps security engineers and pentesters verify the application's security posture.

## Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Ensure login brute-force protection (rate limiting + IP block/lockout)
- [ ] Verify account linking and master alias flows; ensure identity tie and no account takeover
- [ ] Validate RBAC: Owner/Employee/Contractor role boundaries
- [ ] Attempt privilege escalation by forging requests to admin endpoints

## Row-Level Security (RLS)
- [ ] Attempt cross-tenant access to sensitive tables (jobs, timesheets, invoices)
- [ ] Validate RLS rules for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/SELECT

## API & Server
- [ ] SQL injection attempts on all input fields and query params
- [ ] Test for XSS on all inputs and markup rendering points
- [ ] CSRF tests on state-changing endpoints (ensure proper protection)

## Storage & File Uploads
- [ ] Verify that storage buckets are private when required (job photos, invoices)
- [ ] Attempt unauthenticated download of files via guessed URLs
- [ ] Test for malware in uploaded files and validate content-type checking

## Webhooks & External Integrations
- [ ] Verify webhook signature verification for payment provider endpoints
- [ ] Test replay attacks and event idempotency

## Logging & Secrets
- [ ] Check logs for leaked secrets or PII
- [ ] Verify secrets are stored in secret manager and not in repo

## Misc / Infrastructure
- [ ] Test for open ports, unnecessary services on deployed containers
- [ ] Check for outdated dependencies and known CVEs

## Reporting
- Include detailed test steps, endpoints, payloads, observed responses, and recommended mitigations.
- For high severity issues, provide POC and remediation steps.
