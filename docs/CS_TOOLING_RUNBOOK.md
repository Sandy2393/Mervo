# CS Tooling Runbook

## When a customer reports an issue
1) Create ticket (Zendesk) via Contact Support or admin UI.
2) Link provider ticket id to internal record.
3) Update onboarding stage if blocked.

## Escalation
- P1: outages — page engineering.
- P2: major feature blocked — slack channel + ticket.
- P3: minor — queue.

## Onboarding stages
- Account created, Add employees, Post first job, Approve first job, Invite contractors, Training scheduled.

## Notes
- Respect consent before syncing PII to CRM/helpdesk (see PRIVACY_CONSENT_FLOW.md).
- Use dry-run for scripts; require confirm for writes.
