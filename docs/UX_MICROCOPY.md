- **Avoid abbreviations** (e.g., "Sign up" not "Signup")
- **Use "please" sparingly** — less formal is better
- **Errors should specify what went wrong** ("Email already exists" not "Error")
- **Be consistent with terminology** across all pages
- **Support multiple languages** — keep sentences short and clear
