### Speaker Notes
First things first: you need an account. This takes about 10 minutes total.

**Step 1 is straightforward:** Go to the website, sign up. You'll get a verification email. Click the link. Done.

**Step 2 is important:** Your profile is what companies see when they're considering hiring you. The better your profile, the more job offers you'll get.

**Skills:** List what you actually know how to do. If you list "carpentry" but have never built a shelf, and a company hires you for that job, it won't end well. Be honest.

**Service area:** If you're based in Los Angeles, set your service area to Los Angeles (or the neighborhoods you cover). Companies want local contractors.

**Availability:** If you work 9-5 weekdays, say that. If you're available evenings and weekends, say that. Companies need to know when they can reach you.

**Experience level:** This isn't about being an expert. "New" just means this is your first time using the platform. If you have 20 years of carpentry experience, set it to "expert."

**Step 3 is critical:** You can't get paid without a payment method. Add your bank account. Yes, it involves giving us your banking info, but we don't charge fees and we don't touch your money except to deposit your earnings.

**2-factor authentication:** Turn it on. Seriously. If someone hacks your account, they can accept jobs in your name and wreck your reputation. 2FA stops that.

**First 30 days limitation:** We do this to protect both you and companies. It gives you time to learn the platform, and it gives companies confidence that you're reliable before we let you go crazy with job offers.

After 30 days and 4+ star rating → no job limits. You can work as much as you want.

### Speaker Notes
Now let's talk about actually finding work.

**The job listing page** shows all available jobs that match your profile. Not every job is right for you, and that's okay. You're picky about which jobs you take.

**How matching works:** We use your profile data to show you relevant jobs. If you say you're a carpenter and you're in LA, we show you carpentry jobs in LA. We don't show you electrician jobs in New York.

**Reading a job listing carefully is important.** Look at:
- What exactly does the company want?
- Can you actually do this?
- Do you have the right tools/equipment?
- Is the timeline realistic (can you complete by the deadline)?
- Is the pay reasonable?
- Are other contractors saying good things about this company?

**Red flags:** If something feels wrong, probably is. That unusually high pay for simple work? Might be a scam. Company with 1-star rating? Probably hard to work with.

**To accept:** Click the job, read the details, click "Accept." That's it. The company gets a notification. You now own that job—it shows in your "Active Jobs" list.

**After acceptance:** You have 24 hours to contact the company and get details. They'll send you the address, who to contact, photos of what needs to be done, etc.

**Pro tip:** Don't accept a job if you're not actually available to start it. It wastes the company's time and tanks your rating.

### Speaker Notes
You've accepted a job. Now here's how to do it right so you get paid.

**Completing the work:** Do exactly what the company asked. If they said "install shelves level," install them level. If they said "paint the room blue," paint it blue. Don't improvise.

**Photos are critical.** The company can't see your work in person (usually). Photos are their proof that you did the job. Blurry photos = rejected submission = no payment. Take multiple photos from different angles. Show before and after if applicable.

**Time tracking:** If it's an hourly job, track your time accurately. Use the in-app timer if you can—it's automatic and honest. If you have to track manually, do it right. If you say 8 hours but actually worked 6, we can usually tell. It's not worth lying. One rejection tanks your rating.

**Submission:** Write a clear summary of what you did. Include any obstacles or modifications. If something went wrong (you broke something, the customer changed their mind), mention it. Honesty is better than trying to hide it.

**Example:** "Installed tile backsplash as specified. Customer requested color change mid-project (approved by manager). 12 hours total including cleanup."

**After submission:** The company reviews. They might approve immediately or ask questions. "Why is the grout uneven here?" Answer their question. If they ask for fixes, fix it and resubmit. This back-and-forth is normal.

**Rejections happen.** If a job is rejected, the system tells you why. Sometimes you can fix it and resubmit. Sometimes the company made the mistake. You can dispute it. But remember: your rating affects future job offers. High rating (4+ stars) = more jobs, better jobs. Low rating = fewer jobs offered.

**Red flag:** If a company keeps rejecting your work unfairly, let us know. We investigate. We don't want you scammed any more than you do.

### Speaker Notes
Let's talk money and reputation.

**Payment timeline:** This is what people care about. Job submitted, company approves, we process, money in your bank. Worst case, 5-6 days. Usually faster.

**Your earnings dashboard** shows everything. You can see which jobs are approved/pending/disputed. You can see your total earnings and when your next payout is.

**Ratings are everything.** Your rating determines which jobs you can access. Start with no rating. After your first few jobs, you get an average rating. Build it up to 4.5+ stars and you'll have access to better jobs, more job offers, flexible scheduling.

**Low rating?** If you drop below 3.5 stars, you get a warning. If you drop below 3.0, your account gets deactivated. You can reapply after 30 days if you want to try again.

**How to maintain ratings:**
1. Do the job right (most important)
2. Communicate (if something is unclear, ask)
3. Document (take photos, keep records)
4. Be professional (be nice, respond promptly)
5. If you mess up, own it and fix it

**Disputes:** Sometimes companies are unreasonable. You did the work right, they still reject you. You can request a review. We'll look at your evidence (photos, documentation) and their claims. If you're right, you get paid. If you're wrong, you learn and do better next time.

**Red flag companies:** If a company consistently rejects work for bad reasons, we track that. We'll investigate. We're not trying to protect bad contractors OR bad companies.

### Speaker Notes
You're about to join thousands of contractors. You're not alone. We have resources to help you succeed.

**Support:** If you get stuck, help is just a few clicks away. Our support team answers questions in under 24 hours (usually within a few hours). Common questions are in the FAQ.

**Community:** Join Discord or Facebook. You'll find contractors like you, sharing tips, telling stories, helping each other. It's supportive and friendly.

**Mobile app:** Makes it way easier to work. Get job offers in real-time, submit work from the field, track your hours. Download it immediately.

**Your 30-day plan:** This is realistic. Week 1 is setup. Week 2 you do your first job. By the end of month 1, you've got your first payment and you're seeing what works.

**Long-term success:**
- Pick jobs in your wheelhouse. If you're a plumber, do plumbing. You'll get 5-star ratings, get offered better jobs.
- Some companies hire the same contractor repeatedly. Build relationships.
- Your rating is currency. Protect it.
- Higher rating = access to higher-paying jobs.
- Can be full-time income if you want. Many contractors do.

**Final thoughts:** You're about to make money doing work you're good at. On your schedule. With no boss breathing down your neck. We just want to make sure both you and the companies are happy, so we protect everyone.
